#ASOS ASAP

Built for the [Retail Week 2016 Tech Sprint](https://live.retail-week.com/retail-week-tech-sprint-association-dot) using the [On the Dot](https://www.onthedot.com/app/) delivery API:

##Product description

Save yourself from a fashion crisis with ASOS ASAP. Forgotten an anniversary? Ruined your best interview tie? ASOS ASAP brings you the best products from your local Marketplace sellers, delivered within hours, not days.

ASOS ASAP builds on top of the OnTheDot delivery service to find the Marketplace boutique sellers within your area, ready to fulfill your fashion needs. Built to fix time-sensitive fashion failings, products are sorted by readiness-of-delivery so you can salvage your style problems sooner.

ASOS Marketplace lists products from hundreds of independent retailers across the country. Making use of their locality, ASOS ASAP can deliver on the day when the ASOS main warehouse can't. Help a local business to help you when you're in a pickle. Product choices change with your location as you move into the delivery range of new stores.
    
##Future development

- Geolocation for immediate local store lookup
- Notifications if you stray away from your designated delivery area
- Calendar location cross-checking, to deliver your parcel at the earliest convenience
- Independent Marketplace stores could receive stock of the main ASOS website's most popular items, so that these are available locally to be delivered within hours
